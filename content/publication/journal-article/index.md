abstract: This work demonstrates the attractivity of the alpha-skew hyperbolic secant distribution, a new skewed distribution based on the alpha-skew technique and the hyperbolic secant distribution.In the first part, we determine its main features, including its cumulative distribution function, modality, non-central moments, skewness, kurtosis, moment generating function and characteristic function. The remaining part is devoted to the model applicability in a statistical context. As a first step, the parameters are estimated by maximum7 likelihood estimates. Then, we perform a data fitting experiment and compare the values of the Akaike and Bayesian information criteriawith those of some other similar distributions. By considering an astronomical dataset and valuable competitors also based on the alpha-skew technique, the alpha-skew hyperbolic secant distribution turns out to be the best.
